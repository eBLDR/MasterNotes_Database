SQL - Structure Query Language

The model is of a relational nature.
Data is stored in tables.
Suitable for solutions where every record is of the same kind and possesses the same properties.
Adding a new property means you have to alter the whole schema.
The schema is very strict.
ACID transactions are supported.
Scales well vertically.

Popular DBs:

SQLite3, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL


NoSQL - No Structure Query Language

The model is non-relational.
May be stored as JSON, key-value, etc. (depending on type of NoSQL database).
Not every record has to be of the same nature, making it very flexible.
Add new properties to data without disturbing anything.
No schema requirements to adhere to.
Support for ACID transactions can vary depending on which NoSQL DB is used.
Consistency can vary.
Scales well horizontally.
