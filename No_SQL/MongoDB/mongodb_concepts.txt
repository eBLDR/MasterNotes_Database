Default running port: 27017

Run in Docker:
$ docker run -p 27017:27017 [-v ~/localmongodata:/data/db] mongo[:<tag>]
Add the volume if we need data to be persisted even when container is down.

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage.
Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases,
MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value
pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of
documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.
It works on a server, and uses JSON-like document with schema.
An operation on a single document is atomic.

Key Components:
    - _id: This is a field required in every MongoDB document. The _id field
    represents a unique value in the MongoDB document. The _id field is like
    the document's primary key. Its type is ObjectId.
    - Collection: a grouping of MongoDB documents, existing within a single db.
    - Cursor: a pointer to the result set of a query.
    - Database: a container for collections like in RDMS wherein it is a
    container for tables. Each server can store multiple databases.
    - Document: a record in a MongoDB collection is basically called a document.
    The document, in turn, will consist of field name and values. Each document
    can have different fields than other documents in the same collection.
    - Field: a name-value pair in a document. A document has zero or more fields.
