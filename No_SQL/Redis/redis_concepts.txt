Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server, since the keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets
and sorted sets.
Redis is exceptionally fast, its operations are atomic, supports rich data
types, and it's a multi-utility tool (cache, Pub/Sub, messaging-queue, web
sessions...)


redis.conf
    Configuration file at Redis root directory. It is possible to Get and Set
    all configurations from cli (CONFIG command).
